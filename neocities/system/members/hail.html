            <h1>Hello,</h1>
            <p>I'm Halion. Hail is ok too.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>I don't really know how to talk about myself well, but here we are. I'm essentially 29 years old, taken, and a big gym rat.</p>
            <p>I'm also a big lover of indie kidcore and modern aesthetics. It's a tadbit contradicting, but I never really cared. My style is minimalist modern with touches of rainbow here and there, like this page is decorated.</p>
            
            <hr>

            <p>Not really sure what else to add. Please feel free to talk to me if you see me fronting; one of my "resolutions" was to be more social this year. That, and make it to the gym more often, but isn't that everybody's?</p>
