            <h1> I was never really good at drawing...</h1>
            <p> so I opted to find myself SOME kind of creative outlet, and that outlet turned out to be graphic design!</p>
            <br>
            <p> However, of course, we all started out bad, so this will be a portfolio as well as a time capsule for my growth. I started on web design in 2019, when I was 15 years old and have since come a VERY long way.</p>

You may have noticed the insane amount of different usernames I went through throughout my growth. I grew up with extreme self-image problems so I could not stick to one thing. While I still have a similar problem going on with my usernames now, they all have a very similar motif so I'm much easier to identify.">
