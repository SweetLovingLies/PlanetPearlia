                    Hi there! My name is Millie.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <img src="/assets/pixels/wingleft.webp" alt="bullet" class="bullet" width="20" height="20">
                    I'm quite hot headed when it comes down to it.
                </p>

                    Similarly to my source, I try to be lively and cheerful under most situations, but I sometimes come
                    off as a bit overbearing. I'm fully aware of it, but it's slow going to deal with. I sometimes
                    struggle to get my words across correctly and come off as stoic, but I can assure you that I am
                    extremely flexible and understanding as long as you talk to me about things.
                </p>

                    It's rowdy fun or nothing for me. I love the idea of living the life of a party animal, but I
                    haven't really gotten around to doing that! Part of my 2024 resolutions was to work on that, so it's
                    incoming.
                </p>

                    I'm entirely unafraid to cut people off when necessary, but I will put my all in if I think you are
                    too.

                    <h4>Hobbies:</h4>
                <p>
                    
                    I greatly enjoy cooking as of late. I also like practicing hairstyles on the body's hair as well as wigs.
                </p>
                    <h4>Favorite Food:</h4>
                <p>
                    Boy, do I love me some black bean soup. Mhm.
                </p>
                    <h4>Other:</h4>
                <p>
                    I am always looking to meet people from my source as well as Hazbin Hotel! Please come talk to me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    At some point I'll add more info here but for now... I got nothing.
